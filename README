Encrypted Proxy Bridge
By leonardo.labolida.com

The goal is to encrypt the communication between 2 sockets.


How to run a simple test:

	Startup the first node:
	java Startup 963 127.0.0.1 964

	Startup the second node:
	java Startup 964 127.0.0.1 8000
	
	Startup the client tester:
	java TestRequest
	
	
Explain:
	
	The TestRequest connects to the first node at local machine at port 963
	and sends a HTTP common request.
	The first node receives it and connect to the second node at a remote machine at port 964
	and resends the requested data.
	The second node receives it and connect to the next node at port 8000 (port that is running a RealWebServer)
	resends the requested data and receives a HttpResponse that is sent back to the socket requester and so on...
